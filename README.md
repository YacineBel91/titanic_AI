Mini-project 1: Explore Titanic Dataset
(to be presented by each team on Monday, October 26)
Load dataset(s) and make a first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Focus on:
1. missing values;
2. correlations between target (survival) and attributes (and propose interpretations);
3. proposing relevant visualizations.
Each group of student will present using a few slides, and one or more Jupyter notebooks with
your commented Python code, results and graphs.
